----------------------------   

DESCRIPTION
-----------
OS/2 Developer Magazine, GUI Corner column, "The Forbidden Text" - July/August 1994 issue.

Purpose: Compilable 32-Bit edit control source code sample and test routine for various OS/2 compilers.

The behaviour of this control is similar to that provided by OS/2 PM.  Although it may be based on documentation describing programming interfaces and techniques, it should not be misconstrued that this sample code is an official release of the OS/2 PM control and is supported as such.

We are providing the build files for Zortech C++ for OS/2 Version 3.1 even though we were not able to successfully use the DLL.  At this time, we have not had a response from Symantec Corp. on how to solve the problem.  These files are only provided as a convenience.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll


COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, and the the Watcom Linker, intead of the classic ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe

3) Run "make" or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.


TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.7
- wrc 		- Version 2.0beta1
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing make on the directory, but a compile.cmd file is includes to store the log in a file. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
